# AG ProDev Frontend – ReactGuard: Mastering Error Handling

## Overview
This project demonstrates **graceful error handling in a Next.js application** by implementing an **Error Boundary** component with **TypeScript** and integrating it with **Sentry** for real-time error monitoring.  

The solution includes:
- A custom `ErrorBoundary` class component.
- Application-wide integration.
- A test component that intentionally throws errors.
- Error monitoring with **Sentry**.
- User-friendly fallback UI with error recovery.

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn how to:
- Understand how **React Error Boundaries** work.
- Implement a **class component in TypeScript**.
- Handle runtime errors gracefully in a **Next.js** application.
- Integrate third-party error monitoring services like **Sentry**.
- Test error-handling components effectively.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Error Boundaries**: React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Using `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch`.
- **Error Monitoring**: Integrating Sentry to track and log errors in production.
- **Fallback UI**: Showing meaningful error messages to users instead of blank screens.
- **Error Recovery**: Allowing users to retry and recover from non-critical errors.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **React** – UI library  
- **TypeScript** – Typed superset of JavaScript  
- **Next.js** – React framework for SSR and routing  
- **Sentry** – Error monitoring and reporting  
- **Node.js / npm** – Runtime & package manager  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case
Error boundaries are critical in production apps to:
1. Prevent entire app crashes from a single component failure.  
2. Provide clear feedback to users when something breaks.  
3. Track errors for debugging and quick fixes.  
4. Allow recovery without refreshing the whole app.  
5. Maintain reliability and improve user experience.  

This pattern is widely used in large-scale web apps to ensure **stability and maintainability**.

## 🚀 Implementation Summary
- Created an `ErrorBoundary` class component with TypeScript interfaces.  
- Wrapped the main application with `ErrorBoundary`.  
- Built an `ErrorProneComponent` to simulate errors.  
- Integrated **Sentry** for error tracking.  
- Implemented a fallback UI with a **“Try again”** option.
